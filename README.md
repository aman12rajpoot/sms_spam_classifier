# SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning

# Project Overview
This project is a Machine Learning–based SMS Spam Detection system that classifies messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

The system covers the complete ML workflow:
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Text preprocessing
- Feature extraction
- Model training and comparison
- Model evaluation
- Streamlit web application

# Objectives
- Detect spam messages automatically
- Learn end-to-end NLP workflow
- Compare multiple machine learning algorithms
- Build a real-time spam detection interface
